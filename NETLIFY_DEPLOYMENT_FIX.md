# Netlify Deployment Fix for calculatormediefacultate.com

## Problem Diagnosis
Your domain shows "Page not found" because:
1. Your build process includes backend server code that Netlify can't serve
2. React Query dependencies require a server but you're deploying to static hosting
3. The build output directory structure doesn't match Netlify's expectations

## Complete Solution

### Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup
1. Push your latest code to GitHub repository
2. Ensure all files are committed including the updated netlify.toml

### Step 2: Netlify Build Configuration
Your netlify.toml is now configured for static deployment:
```toml
[build]
  command = "node build-static.js"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to Site Settings
2. Build & Deploy → Build Settings
3. Verify Build Command: `node build-static.js`
4. Verify Publish Directory: `dist`
5. Trigger new deployment

### Step 4: Domain Configuration
1. In Netlify: Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add custom domain: calculatormediefacultate.com
3. Configure DNS records with your domain provider:
   - CNAME record: www → your-site.netlify.app
   - A record: @ → 75.2.60.5 (Netlify's IP)

### Step 5: SSL Certificate
Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate for your domain.

## Expected Results
After successful deployment:
- calculatormediefacultate.com will load your grade calculator
- All routes will work due to SPA redirects
- Site will be optimized for Google.ro ranking

## If Issues Persist
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for specific errors
2. Verify GitHub repository has latest code
3. Ensure domain DNS settings are correct
4. Clear browser cache and test in incognito mode
